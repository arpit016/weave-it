# weave-execute

## Purpose

`weave-execute` is the agent-first local task execution workflow for an active Weave change. It carries selected `T#` tasks through branch preparation, implementation, verification, and local task evidence updates.

## Current Behavior

The opencode slash wrapper `/weave-execute` loads the `weave-execute` skill. The skill resolves the active Weave context, detects execution mode, resolves the user's selector, expands dependencies from `Blocked by:`, runs branch prepare for the final task set, implements eligible tasks, verifies them, and updates task-local evidence.

### Execution modes

**Slice mode** (when `wiki/changes/<change-id>/task-slices/` exists):

- Reads tasks from the selected slice's `tasks.md` (or walks slices for `all`).
- Selector: `<slice-id> <task-id>` (e.g. `01 T1`) or `all`.
- Runs `weave slice rollup` at episode boundaries (start and end of execution) for the affected slice(s).
- Branch prep uses repos named on tasks in the selected slice.

**Flat legacy mode** (when only change-root `tasks.md` exists):

- Reads `wiki/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md`.
- Selector: task ids (`T3`), scope (`backend`), or `all`.

Supported invocation shapes:

```text
/weave-execute
/weave-execute T3
/weave-execute T1 T3 T7
/weave-execute backend
/weave-execute all
/weave-execute 01 T1
/weave-execute 02 all
```

When invoked without arguments, the skill asks for slice+task or flat-mode selectors based on detected mode. It does not default to `all`.

Branch preparation is built into `weave-execute` (via `weave task prepare`); `/weave-prepare` is deprecated.

## Domain Model

Selection modes:

- explicit task ids: `T1`, `T1 T3`
- scope: a single non-task, non-`all` value matched against task `Scope`
- all: `all`, meaning all executable `T#` tasks in `tasks.md`

Executable statuses:

- `todo`
- `in_progress`
- `not_tested`

Conditionally executable:

- `blocked` only after all listed blockers are resolved in the same run or are already `done`

Skipped by default:

- `done`
- `invalid`

Only `T#` tasks execute directly. `QF#` findings and `R#` refactor records are source context for related tasks, not execution targets.

## Behavioral Rules

- `Blocked by:` is the dependency source of truth.
- For explicit task id selectors, incomplete blockers outside the explicit selection require user confirmation before expanding the run.
- For scope and `all` selectors, required incomplete blockers are included automatically and run before dependents.
- Missing dependency ids, unclear dependency values, and dependency cycles stop execution before prepare or implementation.
- Prepare always runs before implementation (absorbed from deprecated `weave-prepare`).
- Prepare uses `weave task prepare ... --json`, with `npm run dev -- task prepare ... --json` as the local development fallback when the global `weave` command is unavailable.
- In slice mode, rollup runs before and after the execution episode for affected slices.
- Prepare blockers stop execution before implementation.
- Each task moves to `in_progress` when task work begins.
- A task moves to `done` only when implementation is complete and verification passes.
- A task moves to `not_tested` only when implementation appears complete but verification could not run.
- A failed or incomplete task remains `in_progress` with concise notes.
- Independent tasks may continue after an unrelated failure.
- Downstream tasks whose dependencies failed are skipped and summarized.
- HITL tasks are included in `all`, but the agent pauses before each HITL task for required human input.

## Task Evidence

`weave-execute` updates `tasks.md` narrowly:

- active task index status for affected tasks
- detail section `Status:` for affected tasks
- acceptance criteria checkboxes that were actually satisfied
- concise verification notes under each affected task's `### Verification` section

It does not rewrite unrelated task wording, unrelated sections, `QF#` entries, `R#` entries, invalid task history, or global task sections unless a selected task's own evidence requires a narrow local note.

## Non-Goals And Side Effects

`weave-execute` is local-only. It does not:

- add `weave task execute`
- commit
- push
- open pull requests
- create remote branches
- stash, discard, force-checkout, or otherwise resolve dirty work automatically
- publish external issue tracker updates
- create per-repo task artifacts
- create a separate execution run-history artifact or `status.yml` execution log

## Change History

- 2026-06-07 (change `260607-bbam-task-execution-workflow`): introduced `/weave-execute` as a bundled agent skill and opencode wrapper for local task execution, prepare delegation, dependency handling, HITL pauses, verification, and narrow `tasks.md` evidence updates.
- 2026-06-09 (change `260609-rrsq-weave-slice`): dual-mode slice vs flat legacy execution; built-in branch prep; rollup episode boundaries; slice selector `/<slice-id> <task-id>`.

## Open Questions

- Whether future versions should add a deterministic task-evidence update helper or `weave task execute` command. V1 keeps execution in the agent skill.
