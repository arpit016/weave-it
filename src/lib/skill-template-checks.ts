export const EXPECTED_SILENT_COMMAND_OUTPUT = `# Silent Weave Command Output

Weave skills run Weave CLI commands silently by default. Use command results
as internal context, not response content.

Do not show raw stdout, JSON payloads, command echoes, lifecycle payloads,
internal state-write confirmations, or verbatim notice text unless the user
explicitly asks for diagnostic output.

Surface only information that changes what the user or agent should do next:
blockers, failures, missing relevant repos, branch or task outcomes,
lifecycle failures, package-outdated notices, relevant outdated or modified
skills, and user-required actions.

Notice handling:

- \`package_outdated\`: show only when present. Say exactly:
  \`A newer Weave version is available. Run \\\`weave status\\\` for details, then upgrade Weave when convenient.\`
- \`skills_outdated\`: suppress unrelated skills. If the invoked skill is outdated, say:
  \`The installed \\\`<skill-name>\\\` skill appears older than the bundled template. Run \\\`weave status\\\` for details, then \\\`weave agent update --all\\\` when you want to refresh installed skills.\`
- \`skills_outdated\`: if multiple skills used in this workflow are outdated, say:
  \`Some installed skills used in this workflow appear older than the bundled templates: \\\`<skill-a>\\\`, \\\`<skill-b>\\\`. Run \\\`weave status\\\` for details, then \\\`weave agent update --all\\\` when you want to refresh them.\`
- \`skills_modified\`: suppress unless the invoked skill is modified locally or the user is asking about skill updates. If the invoked skill is modified, say:
  \`The installed \\\`<skill-name>\\\` skill has local edits, so its behavior may differ from the bundled template. Run \\\`weave status\\\` or \\\`weave agent diff\\\` if you want to inspect the difference.\`
- \`skills_modified\`: if the user asks to update skills and installed skills have local edits, say:
  \`Some installed skills have local edits. \\\`weave agent update\\\` may skip or protect them; run \\\`weave status\\\` or \\\`weave agent diff\\\` before updating.\`

Do not say \`Notices: ...\`, \`The command returned notices\`, raw
\`notices[].message\`, full notice JSON, or full skill lists unless the user
asks for diagnostics.

export const EXPECTED_PLAN_MODE_GUARD = `# Plan Mode Guard

This skill must run in Plan Mode.

If the current environment exposes collaboration mode and it is not Plan Mode, stop immediately and say:

\`This skill must run in Plan Mode. Switch to Plan Mode, then invoke <skill-name> again.\`

Do not inspect deeply, ask discovery questions, update artifacts, or continue work before this guard passes.

Static Weave skill content cannot automatically switch collaboration mode. The host, user, or developer layer must switch modes before this skill continues.

In Plan Mode, this skill resolves the active branch-derived change and treats \`<lane>\` as the explicit target lane. It does not write local artifact lane state.

Do not write repo-tracked artifacts directly. Produce the plan, decisions, questions, or proposed artifact changes needed for the user to approve. Actual artifact writes happen only after the user exits Plan Mode and asks to implement the plan.
` as const;

export const EXPECTED_LIFECYCLE_SYNC_PROTOCOL = `# Lifecycle Staleness Verification

Before calling \`weave change progress\`, verify content-sync of every artifact
that would otherwise be marked stale by the default pessimistic propagation.

The \`--source\` arguments of \`weave change progress\` declare causal influence,
not strict-DAG dependency. Pessimistic staleness propagation is the safe default,
not the only correct answer. When the clarification this skill just performed is
narrowly contained (a typo fix, a sentence rewording, an open-question
resolution), dependents may already be in content sync; flagging them stale
creates churn the user did not ask for.

Procedure:

1. Identify the set of structural dependents of the lane being progressed. Read
   \`wiki/changes/<change-id>/status.yml\` and compute which lanes list this
   lane in their \`artifacts.<lane>.sources\`.
2. For each dependent lane, read both the dependent artifact and the artifact
   just being progressed. Decide whether the change you just made invalidates
   the dependent's content. The judgement is binary per lane: invalidates, or
   does not invalidate.
3. Select the appropriate progress invocation:

   - Every dependent is invalidated (or there are no dependents):
     \`weave change progress <lane> --source <list> --json\` (default, no new flags)
   - No dependent is invalidated:
     \`weave change progress <lane> --source <list> --no-invalidate --json\`
   - Some dependents are invalidated, some are not:
     \`weave change progress <lane> --source <list> --invalidate=<comma-list> --json\`

4. If a previously-stale dependent is now in content sync (because the upstream
   change has been absorbed but the stale flag still lingers from an earlier
   pessimistic propagation), clear it explicitly:

   \`weave change clear-stale <lane> --reason "<one-sentence verification>" --json\`

   Always pass \`--reason\` so the audit entry in \`stale_history\` carries the
   verification rationale. Do not clear flags without reading both artifacts.

5. Never edit \`status.yml\` by hand to manipulate stale state. Use the CLI.

Failure mode: if you are uncertain whether a dependent is in content sync,
prefer the pessimistic default (omit \`--no-invalidate\` and \`--invalidate\`).
The user can always run \`weave-clarify <lane>\` later. A false-positive stale
flag is recoverable; silently leaving a real downstream artifact mismatched is
not.
